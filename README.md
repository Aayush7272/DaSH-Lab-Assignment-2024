This was a roller coaster ride for me.
I never done coding in my life and doing and learning for the fist time in less than a week was fun.
I got to know about Code with Harry, Python, Linux (my new love) and many other things.
Sitting in CC for 2-4 hrs daily was painful.
I learned the basics of pyhton, API and how LLM works.
The output of the "message" in this code is stuck by the error 429 and I am unable to resolve it.
In nutshell, it was a fun and tiring experience.
